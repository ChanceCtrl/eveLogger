It actually does shit now, probably, the Vector Nav boi has been tested and the Telemetry stuff should work based off other tests.

There is also a header file in "included" now with some of the Vector Nav things, and another for the GPS functions to help clean up the main.cpp

Also you can toggle what features you want with the #define statements at the top, not all combos have been tested however, but it does compile with everything on...

I really want to put some sarcastic remark at the end of this, but I have too much other shit to do.
